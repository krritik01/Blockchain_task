Unfortunately, it's not possible to directly transfer Testnet BNB from that contract to a BSC address using the 'transferFunds' function.

The use of 'delegatecall' in the provided contract lacks the inherent capabilities needed for cross-chain asset transfers. 'delegatecall' allows contract code execution in a shared context but doesn't inherently support cross-chain interactions required for transferring Testnet BNB to a BSC address. It lacks the specific functionalities and protocols necessary for handling such cross-chain asset transfers.
